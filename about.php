            <b><p>
            Kapılar is a freespace, community centre and information point for the communities of Basmane, in central Izmir.

            <br>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            Kapılar works to be a welcoming and safer space for people to come together, to socialise, and to share useful information regarding life in Basmane and Izmir. It is a space for all regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ability or age.

            <p>
            <b>Izmir is the main city of transit for migrants attempting to reach Europe</b> and has been a city of migration for centuries. Since the outbreak of the war in Syria, thousands of families have made the city their new home, and have been forced to start a new life in a country which organisations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, among others, have conclusively established as unsafe for refugees.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            <b>Many of these families have settled in Basmane,</b> a neighbourhood characterised by a diverse community, including long-term residents from Izmir and other parts of Anatolia, particularly Kurdish and Arab regions, as well as migrants from other parts of the middle-East, Asia and Africa. According to official figures, over 120,000 Syrians have settled in the city over the past six years – not including the tens of thousands of unregistered residents.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            <b>The community is financially poor,</b> housing is crowded, education is limited, job opportunities are rare and basic needs are barely met. Discrimination is an everyday issue, despite community efforts to address them. Kapılar aims to confront these divisions through cultural activities and community building.

            <h1 class="text-size-30"><b>What We Do</b></h1>
            <p>
            We have organised language classes for over 100 people, 
            literacy programs for Syrian teenagers and women, 
            community kitchen events for those coming from near and far, 
            and weekly football matches for Syrian child- and teenage-workers. 
            We have hosted film screenings, puppet shows for children as part of 
            Izmir’s International Puppet Festival, concerts, workshops and trainings on refugee rights, 
            children rights and other educational activities for our members.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            <b>Educational Opportunities</b>
            We have an ongoinpro education programme which includes language, 
            vocational and recreational activities. 
            Our educational workshops are led by certified and experienced facilitators 
            who have gone through a rigorous training on refugee rights, 
            children’s rights and trauma-informed education theories and practices.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            <b>Social Activities</b>
            We also organise people’s kitchens, film screenings, women’s meetings, and food events where people create new friendships and networks of solidarity. Discussion groups on issues from Turkish refugee law to workers’ rights have provided beautiful moments for sharing and learning for volunteers and locals.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-30">
            <b>Cultural Mediation and Knowledge Sharing</b>
            Using language lessons, translations and the sharing of information on rights, work opportunities and accessing services as mediums for exchange, Kapılar serves as a cultural mediator between Basmane’s many communities.
            We also host an information point which locals can access weekly to learn more about their rights and obligations, receive information on how to register, access education and health services, as well as referring people to relevant local services run by public institutions and non-governmental organisations.
